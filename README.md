# Happy Childhood Project
This project, aims to tackle practices and implement materials taught as part of the Blockchain Fundamentals course, by creating a smart contract used by a particular and hypothetical children's organization, which does funding(including withdrawal of funds) using ETH.

The web3 application can be found on the link: https://happychildhood.ajlaherenda.repl.co/

Interactable only with the Metamask extension and Goerli ETH(network id 5).

Replit frontend, which can be forked for future use: https://replit.com/@ajlaherenda/HappyChildhood?v=1

# Disclaimer:
The project is hardcoded to be sending funds to a previously deployed contract, whose owner is hardcoded as well.
The previous variables are fetched from a .env file which contains the delicate information and is ignored therefore.
